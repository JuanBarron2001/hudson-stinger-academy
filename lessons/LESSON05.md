## üéØ Overview
**Keywords:** Java, If Statements, Boolean, Else, Else If, Comparison Operators, Scanner, Strings, Conditions  
Learn to:
- Write and structure `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements  
- Use Boolean variables directly in conditions  
- Compare values with relational and equality operators (`>=`, `==`, etc.)  
- Prompt the user for input with `Scanner` and branch logic accordingly  
- Handle strings with `.isEmpty()` and Boolean input with `nextBoolean()`  
- Understand order of conditions and why placement matters

## üíª Part 1 ‚Äì Java‚ÄëOnly (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Create an integer variable `age`.  
- Write an `if` statement that checks if `age >= 18`.  
- Print `"You are an adult"` if true.  
- Add an `else` clause to print `"You are a child"`.  

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Expand with multiple conditions:  
  - `age < 0` ‚Üí `"You haven‚Äôt been born yet"`  
  - `age == 0` ‚Üí `"You are a baby"`  
  - `age >= 65` ‚Üí `"You are a senior"`  
- Prompt the user for their age using `Scanner` and test the branching logic.

## ü§ñ Part 2 ‚Äì Robot Code (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Use an `if` statement to check if joystick input is above a threshold (e.g., `> 0.1`).  
- If true, set motor speed to joystick value.  
- Else, set motor speed to zero.  

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Add multiple conditions:  
  - If joystick input is very small, treat it as ‚Äúdeadband‚Äù (ignore noise).  
  - If joystick input is high, cap motor speed at a safe maximum.  
- Print results to **SmartDashboard** for debugging.

## üìú Part 3 ‚Äì Code Archaeology (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Find an `if` statement in last year‚Äôs robot code.  
- Explain what condition it checks and why it‚Äôs important (e.g., safety, limits, mode switching).  

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Suggest improvements:  
  - Could the conditions be reordered for clarity?  
  - Could repeated checks be simplified with Boolean variables?  
- Or write pseudo‚Äëcode for a new feature, e.g.:  
  [CODE BLOCK]java
  if (distanceToGoal < 2) {
      shootBall();
  } else if (distanceToGoal < 5) {
      adjustShooterAngle();
  } else {
      driveCloser();
  }

[CODE BLOCK]LOG
Ideas:
- Use joystick deadband logic as a real-world ‚Äúif statement‚Äù example.
- Archaeology: check for safety interlocks (e.g., ‚Äúif limit switch is pressed, stop motor‚Äù).
- Segue: This lesson builds naturally from arithmetic (Lesson 04) ‚Üí now we make decisions with those values.
- Future: Combine if statements with loops for Lesson 06.
