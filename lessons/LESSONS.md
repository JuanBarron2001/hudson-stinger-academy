## 📌 Lesson Status Key

- **[IDEA]** – Placeholder for a lesson that’s planned but not yet started.  
- **[AI SLOB]** – Draft auto‑generated from AI transcription of a YouTube video. Expect rough edges, missing context, and no test data yet.  
- **[DRAFT]** – A first pass written/edited by me, but not yet tied into robot examples or exercises.  
- **[WORK IN PROGRESS]** – Currently being refined with robot‑specific connections, examples, and exercises.  
- **[READY FOR REVIEW]** – Lesson looks complete, but still needs testing or peer review before being finalized.  
- **[COMPLETE]** – Fully reviewed, polished, connected to robot code, and includes test data for practice.  
- **[NEEDS UPDATE]** – Lesson was once complete but is now outdated (e.g., new Java version, FRC library changes, or better examples needed).

## 💡 Tips for Using This Guide

- **Follow in order** if you’re new — each lesson builds on the last.
- **Experiment** — break the code, then fix it. That’s how you learn.
- **Ask questions** — no one learns FRC code alone.
