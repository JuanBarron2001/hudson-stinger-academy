## üìå Lesson Status Key

- **[IDEA]** ‚Äì Placeholder for a lesson that‚Äôs planned but not yet started.  
- **[AI SLOB]** ‚Äì Draft auto‚Äëgenerated from AI transcription of a YouTube video. Expect rough edges, missing context, and no test data yet.  
- **[DRAFT]** ‚Äì A first pass written/edited by me, but not yet tied into robot examples or exercises.  
- **[WORK IN PROGRESS]** ‚Äì Currently being refined with robot‚Äëspecific connections, examples, and exercises.  
- **[READY FOR REVIEW]** ‚Äì Lesson looks complete, but still needs testing or peer review before being finalized.  
- **[COMPLETE]** ‚Äì Fully reviewed, polished, connected to robot code, and includes test data for practice.  
- **[NEEDS UPDATE]** ‚Äì Lesson was once complete but is now outdated (e.g., new Java version, FRC library changes, or better examples needed).

## üí° Tips for Using This Guide

- **Follow in order** if you‚Äôre new ‚Äî each lesson builds on the last.
- **Experiment** ‚Äî break the code, then fix it. That‚Äôs how you learn.
- **Ask questions** ‚Äî no one learns FRC code alone.
