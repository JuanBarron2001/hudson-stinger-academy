## 💻 Part 1 – Java‑Only (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Complete the **homework from the video**:  
  - Create **five variables** — one each for: a string, an integer, a double, a char, and a boolean.  
  - Print them all to the console.

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Write a **simple introduction program** that:  
  - Stores your **name**, **grade**, and **age** as variables (no types given — you choose the correct ones).  
  - Stores whether you are a **senior** as a boolean.  
  - Uses an `if / else` statement:  
    - If senior → print `"Almost there!"`  
    - Else → print `"School is fun!"`  
  - Bonus creativity points: include **at least two more variables** of your choice (e.g., favorite subject, GPA, club name) and weave them into your introduction.

---

## 🤖 Part 2 – Robot Code (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Output your **team number** to the **SmartDashboard** as a variable.

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Output **multiple variables** to the SmartDashboard:  
  - Team number  
  - Team name  
  - At least **two more values** of different types (e.g., robot speed as a double, match-ready status as a boolean, driver name as a string).  
  - The goal is to experiment with **different data types** in SmartDashboard.

---

## 📜 Part 3 – Code Archaeology (2 pts)

**Basic (1 pt)**  
- Find **one variable** in last year’s robot code and answer:  
  - Where is it being used?  
  - Why is it being used?  
  - What can you infer from its name?

**Extra (1 pt)**  
- Option 1: Find a **magic number** in the code (see [Magic number – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29)) that should be replaced with a named variable or constant. Leave a comment explaining why.  
- Option 2: Find a **poorly named variable**. Leave a comment suggesting a better name and why it improves clarity.
